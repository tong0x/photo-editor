Photo-Editor


A lightweight photo editor including essential sharpening and blurring filters, as well as accurate, content-aware resizing

Hi, please run the gui.py in our folder as it will trigger our user interface.

Instruction of using the interface:
1.	Use the “Open” button to open any image as you want
2.	Click any other button to apply the corresponding function to the picture uploaded
a.	If doing resizing (carving), please enter the number of rows and number of columns you want to remove from the image at the top-right corner of the user interface
b.	Carving might take a while to perform (approx. (nc + nr) * 3 seconds to run)
3.	Close the window when you are finished

Note: 3 jpg images are attached for you to test it out!
